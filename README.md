php-buffer
==========
Like http://bufferapp.com but uses rabbitmq and php.  Stupid-simple.

Spin up a rabbitmq server on a machine somewhere.  Edit config.php to point to it.  Get some OAuth tokens and bit.ly tokens and fill in where appropriate (search for 'xxxx' and replace appropriately).

You can point your Google Reader urls at the submit.php url to auto-submit from Google Reader or any other reader that accepts urls.
